In this lab we have access to a coupon code and a gift card 
if we use the coupon to buy the giftcard after that you will see that you get more money (benifit)
The website is vulnirable to business logic because you can do it a multiple time using an automated process and getting unlimited amount of money
we will uses a macro with the requests that you need to buy a gift-card with the coupon code and place the order
to repeat the process without getting banned we will use intruder with a NULL payload 
for the gift card number we will consider it as a custom charracter
